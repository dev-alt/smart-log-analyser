## Development Notes

### Go Version Compatibility
- Using Go 1.18.1
- Had to use compatible version of golang.org/x/crypto (v0.17.0) due to missing packages in Go 1.18

### British English Conversion Process
- Systematic search and replace across all files
- Directory and file renames
- Import path updates
- Function and variable name changes
- Documentation updates
- CLI command changes

### SSH Implementation Approach
- Used golang.org/x/crypto/ssh for SSH connectivity
- Implemented file transfer via SSH commands (cat) instead of SFTP for simplicity
- JSON configuration for ease of use
- Password authentication as requested (root@ access)

### Security Considerations for Production
- Currently uses InsecureIgnoreHostKey for host key verification
- Passwords stored in plain text JSON
- Recommended improvements: SSH key authentication, proper host verification

### Session 7: Fix Configuration File Persistence Issue
**User Request**: "whenever i run root@****:~/projects/smart-log-analyser# ./smart-log-analyser download --init it resets the server.json file. This file needs to be persistant"

**Issue Identified**: 
The `--init` flag was always overwriting existing `servers.json` files, causing users to lose their configured server credentials.

**Tasks Completed**:
1. ✅ **Analyzed servers.json overwrite issue**
   - Located problem in `remote.CreateSampleConfig()` function
   - Function was using `os.WriteFile()` without checking if file exists
   - `handleCreateConfig()` in download command was not handling existing files

2. ✅ **Fixed download --init to not overwrite existing config**
   - Modified `CreateSampleConfig()` to check if file exists with `os.Stat()`
   - Return descriptive error if file already exists instead of overwriting
   - Updated `handleCreateConfig()` to handle existing files gracefully
   - Added helpful display of current configuration when file exists

3. ✅ **Tested the fix with existing configuration**
   - Verified `./smart-log-analyser download --init` no longer overwrites
   - Shows current configuration summary when file exists  
   - Tested creating new config with different filename works correctly
   - Added missing `strings` import for error message checking

4. ✅ **Updated documentation**
   - Updated README.md to clarify `--init` behavior
   - Added note that `--init` will not overwrite existing files
   - Added example for creating config with different filename
   - Updated command descriptions to reflect safe behavior

**Code Changes**:
- `pkg/remote/config.go` - Added file existence check in `CreateSampleConfig()`
- `cmd/download.go` - Enhanced `handleCreateConfig()` with better error handling and user feedback
- `README.md` - Updated documentation to reflect non-destructive behavior

**Security Review**:
- ✅ Verified no sensitive data in changes
- ✅ Fix actually improves security by preventing accidental credential loss
- ✅ No real credentials exposed in code or documentation

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ Existing `servers.json` files are preserved
- ✅ Helpful feedback shown when file already exists
- ✅ New files can still be created with different names
- ✅ No regression in other functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `pkg/remote/config.go` - Added file existence check
- `cmd/download.go` - Enhanced error handling and user feedback  
- `README.md` - Updated documentation for clarity

---

### Session 8: Implement Multi-File Download Feature
**User Request**: "i found an issue, it only downloaded 1 file. my server contained [extensive log file listing showing many access.log files, compressed logs, etc.]"

**Issue Identified**: 
The download feature only downloaded the single file specified in `log_path` configuration, but servers typically have many log files including rotated logs, compressed archives, and logs from different services.

**Tasks Completed**:
1. ✅ **Analyzed single file download issue**
   - Current implementation only downloaded `server.LogPath` (e.g., `/var/log/nginx/access.log`)
   - User's server had 20+ access log files including rotated and compressed logs
   - Missing functionality for bulk download of multiple log files

2. ✅ **Enhanced download feature for multiple log files**
   - Added `ListAccessLogFiles()` method to SSH client
   - Enhanced `ListLogFiles()` with better file discovery using `find` command
   - Improved file filtering to find access logs, rotated logs, and compressed files

3. ✅ **Added options for selecting which log files to download**
   - `--list`: List available log files without downloading
   - `--all`: Download all access log files (current + rotated)
   - `--max-files`: Limit number of files to download (default: 10)
   - Enhanced command-line interface with new flags

4. ✅ **Updated documentation for multi-file download**
   - Added comprehensive multi-file download section to README
   - Updated command examples with new options
   - Added bulk download behavior explanations
   - Updated command-line options documentation

5. ✅ **Tested multi-file download functionality**
   - `./smart-log-analyser download --list` successfully found 20 access log files
   - `./smart-log-analyser download --all --max-files 3` downloaded 3 files (747KB total)
   - Smart file naming with hostname_timestamp_originalname format
   - Progress tracking and summary statistics working correctly

**Code Changes**:
- `pkg/remote/ssh_client.go`: Added `ListAccessLogFiles()` method with `find` command
- `cmd/download.go`: Major enhancement with multi-file download logic
  - Added new command flags: `--all`, `--list`, `--max-files`
  - Added `handleListFiles()` function for file discovery
  - Enhanced `handleDownload()` with multi-file support
  - Progress tracking and download statistics

**New Features**:
- **File Discovery**: Lists all access log files including rotated and compressed
- **Bulk Download**: Download multiple files with `--all` flag
- **Smart Limiting**: Configurable max files with `--max-files`
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows download progress for each file with sizes
- **File Naming**: Prevents conflicts with hostname_timestamp_originalname format

**Testing Results**:
```bash
# Discovered 20 files on server
./smart-log-analyser download --list
# Output: Found access.log, forum.access.log, *.gz files, etc.

# Downloaded 3 files successfully
./smart-log-analyser download --all --max-files 3
# Output: 3/3 files downloaded (747,818 bytes total)
```

**Security Review**:
- ✅ No sensitive data in code changes
- ✅ File operations use secure patterns
- ✅ Download directory properly excluded from git

**Files Modified**:
- `pkg/remote/ssh_client.go` - Enhanced file listing capabilities
- `cmd/download.go` - Major multi-file download enhancement
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation update
- `.development_log.md` - Session 8 documentation

**User Problem Solved**: 
Instead of downloading only 1 file, users can now:
- List all available log files (`--list`)
- Download all access logs with `--all` flag  
- Control how many files to download with `--max-files`
- Get progress feedback and download statistics

---

### Session 9: Change Default Download Behavior to Multi-File
**User Request**: "yes, the default should download all"

**Issue**: After implementing multi-file download feature, the default behavior still downloaded only single files, requiring users to remember to use the `--all` flag.

**Tasks Completed**:
1. ✅ **Changed default download behavior to download all files**
   - Modified logic to make multi-file download the default behavior
   - Added `--single` flag for when users want only the main log file
   - Updated `downloadAll` to `singleFile` logic inversion

2. ✅ **Updated documentation for new default behavior**
   - Updated README.md command examples to reflect new default
   - Changed documentation to show single file as optional (`--single`)
   - Updated command-line options documentation
   - Updated download behavior section with new defaults

3. ✅ **Tested new default behavior**
   - Verified `./smart-log-analyser download` now downloads multiple files by default
   - Tested `--single` flag downloads only one file
   - Confirmed `--max-files` still works to limit downloads
   - All functionality working as expected

**Code Changes**:
- `cmd/download.go`: 
  - Inverted logic from `downloadAll` to `singleFile` flag
  - Changed default behavior to download all access log files
  - Added `--single` flag for single-file downloads
  - Updated help text and flag descriptions

**New Behavior**:
- **Default**: `./smart-log-analyser download` downloads all access log files (up to 10)
- **Single**: `./smart-log-analyser download --single` downloads only configured log file
- **Limited**: `./smart-log-analyser download --max-files 20` downloads up to 20 files
- **Backward Compatible**: `--all` flag still works (same as default)

**Testing Results**:
```bash
# Default behavior - downloads multiple files
./smart-log-analyser download --max-files 3
# Output: 📦 Downloading 3 access log files... (773,174 bytes total)

# Single file mode
./smart-log-analyser download --single  
# Output: 📄 Downloading single log file (7,998 bytes)
```

**User Experience Improvement**:
- No longer need to remember `--all` flag for multi-file downloads
- Intuitive default behavior matches user expectations
- Single file download available when needed with `--single`
- Better discoverability through help text

**Files Modified**:
- `cmd/download.go` - Changed default behavior logic and flags
- `README.md` - Updated all documentation to reflect new defaults
- `.development_log.md` - Session 9 documentation

## Session 11: Enhanced Analytics and Visual Display (2025-08-23)

### User Request
- **Goal**: "lets work on analytics now, lets just make it simple. First lets work on what we are anayling and second how we can nicely display this data to the user."
- **Focus**: Enhance the existing analytics capabilities and improve data presentation

### Current State Analysis
**Existing Analytics (Phase 1)**:
- Basic statistics: Total requests, date range
- Status code distribution (grouped by classes)
- Top IP addresses and URLs
- Plain text output with minimal formatting

**Available Data Not Being Used**:
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
- Response sizes (bytes transferred)
- Individual status codes vs classes
- Unique visitor/resource counts

### Enhanced Analytics Implementation

1. **New Analytics Metrics Added**:
   - **HTTP Method Analysis**: Breakdown of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests with percentages
   - **Data Transfer Analytics**: Total bytes transferred and average response size
   - **Unique Counts**: Unique IP addresses and unique URLs accessed
   - **Percentage Calculations**: All metrics now show percentage of total requests

2. **Visual Display Improvements**:
   - **Structured Layout**: Box-style header with consistent section formatting
   - **Emoji Categories**: 📊 Overview, 🔧 HTTP Methods, 📈 Status Codes, 🌐 IPs, 🔗 URLs
   - **Tree-style Display**: Using ├─ and └─ characters for hierarchical presentation
   - **Number Formatting**: Added comma separators for large numbers (e.g., "4,296")
   - **Byte Formatting**: Human-readable sizes (B, KB, MB, GB) instead of raw bytes
   - **URL Truncation**: Long URLs truncated to 60 characters with "..." for readability

3. **Technical Implementation**:
   - **New Struct**: Added `MethodStat` for HTTP method statistics
   - **Enhanced Results**: Extended `Results` struct with new fields:
     - `HTTPMethods []MethodStat`
     - `TotalBytes int64`
     - `AverageSize int64` 
     - `UniqueIPs int`
     - `UniqueURLs int`

**Security Issue Identified**: 
- Sensitive patterns (specific IP addresses and domain names) were present in repository files
- Development log contained references to real server data
- Sensitive data detection script ironically contained the sensitive patterns it was supposed to detect
- Git history contained sensitive information that needed complete removal

**Tasks Completed**:
1. ✅ **Comprehensive Security Audit**
   - Identified sensitive data in scripts/check-sensitive-data.sh (specific IP and domain patterns)
   - Found sensitive references in .development_log.md (real server logs and domain names)  
   - Located sensitive data in output/data.json (real domain references)
   - Confirmed git history contained this sensitive information across multiple commits

2. ✅ **Sanitized Repository Files**
   - Updated check-sensitive-data.sh to use generic regex patterns instead of specific values
   - Replaced specific IP addresses and domain names with generic placeholders in development log
   - Removed output/data.json file containing real domain references
   - All examples now use generic 'server-logs/access.log' and 'example.com' placeholders

3. ✅ **Complete Git History Rewrite**
   - Created sanitization script using git filter-branch to rewrite entire repository history
   - Applied regex replacements across all commits: specific IP → SERVER_IP, domain → example.com
   - Removed sensitive output files from all historical commits
   - Force pushed cleaned history to GitHub, permanently removing sensitive data

4. ✅ **Post-Cleanup Verification**
   - Ran comprehensive sensitive data detection - no specific patterns found
   - Verified git history no longer contains sensitive information
   - Confirmed all examples use generic placeholders
   - Cleaned up git repository (removed backup refs, aggressive garbage collection)

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/check-sensitive-data.sh` - Replaced specific patterns with generic regex patterns
- `.development_log.md` - Sanitized all references to real server data throughout entire file
- Removed: `output/data.json` - Contained real domain data
- Git history completely rewritten - 28 commits processed and sanitized

**Technical Implementation**:
```bash
# History sanitization approach
FILTER_BRANCH_SQUELCH_WARNING=1 git filter-branch --force --tree-filter '
    sed -i "s/[REAL_IP]/SERVER_IP/g" .development_log.md
    sed -i "s/[REAL_DOMAIN]/example.com/g" .development_log.md
    rm -f output/data.json
' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Force push to completely replace GitHub history
git push --force origin master
```

**Security Improvements**:
- **Zero Sensitive Data**: No real IP addresses, domain names, or server details in repository
- **Generic Examples**: All documentation uses placeholder values (example.com, 192.168.1.100)
- **History Cleaned**: Complete git history rewrite removed all traces of sensitive information
- **Pattern-Based Detection**: Detection script now uses regex patterns instead of specific values
- **Permanent Removal**: Force push ensures sensitive data cannot be recovered from GitHub
