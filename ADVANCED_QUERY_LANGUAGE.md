# Advanced Query Language Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive SQL-like query language (SLAQ - Smart Log Analyser Query Language) for advanced log filtering and analysis.

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Lexer** (`pkg/query/lexer.go`)
   - Tokenizes query strings into structured tokens
   - Handles keywords, operators, literals, and identifiers
   - Supports string literals, numbers, dates, and field names

2. **Parser** (`pkg/query/parser.go`) 
   - Builds Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokens
   - Implements recursive descent parser
   - Handles SELECT statements with full SQL-like syntax

3. **Evaluator** (`pkg/query/evaluator.go`)
   - Executes operations on individual log entries
   - Implements comparison, logical, and string operations
   - Handles function calls and special operators

4. **Executor** (`pkg/query/executor.go`)
   - Processes queries against log datasets
   - Handles aggregation, grouping, sorting, and limiting
   - Manages query execution pipeline

5. **High-level Interface** (`pkg/query/query.go`)
   - Provides user-friendly query engine
   - Includes query builder and helper utilities
   - Contains prebuilt query templates

## Features Implemented

### Query Syntax Support
- ✅ SELECT with field selection and wildcards
- ✅ FROM clause (logs table)
- ✅ WHERE conditions with complex expressions
- ✅ GROUP BY aggregation
- ✅ ORDER BY sorting (ASC/DESC)
- ✅ HAVING clause for aggregate filtering
- ✅ LIMIT for result pagination

### Data Types
- ✅ Strings with quote support
- ✅ Integers and floating-point numbers
- ✅ Boolean values (TRUE/FALSE)
- ✅ Timestamps with multiple format support
- ✅ Lists for IN operations

### Operators
- ✅ Comparison: `=`, `!=`, `<>`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
- ✅ String matching: `LIKE`, `CONTAINS`, `STARTS_WITH`, `ENDS_WITH`
- ✅ Logical: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
- ✅ Special: `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `IN_RANGE`

### Functions
- ✅ Aggregate: `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`
- ✅ Time: `HOUR()`, `DAY()`, `WEEKDAY()`, `DATE()`
- ✅ String: `UPPER()`, `LOWER()`, `LENGTH()`, `SUBSTR()`
- ✅ Network: `IS_PRIVATE_IP()`, `COUNTRY()` (basic implementation)

### Output Formats
- ✅ Table format (default) with aligned columns
- ✅ CSV format with proper escaping
- ✅ JSON format with structured data

## Integration Points

### CLI Integration
- Added `--query` flag for executing custom queries
- Added `--query-format` flag for output format selection
- Integrated with existing time filtering (`--since`, `--until`)
- Enhanced help documentation with examples

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error reporting with position information
- Query validation before execution
- Helpful error suggestions via QueryHelper
- Graceful handling of malformed data

## Testing Results

### Basic Queries ✅
```bash
./smart-log-analyser analyse testdata/sample_access.log --query "SELECT * FROM logs WHERE status = 404"
```

### Aggregation Queries ✅
```bash
./smart-log-analyser analyse testdata/sample_access.log --query "SELECT ip, COUNT() FROM logs GROUP BY ip ORDER BY COUNT() DESC LIMIT 10"
```

### Complex Filtering ✅
```bash
./smart-log-analyser analyse testdata/sample_access.log --query "SELECT method, AVG(size), COUNT() FROM logs GROUP BY method"
```

### Multiple Output Formats ✅
- Table format: Professional aligned output
- CSV format: Machine-readable with proper escaping  
- JSON format: Structured data for APIs/integrations

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- Single-pass filtering for WHERE conditions
- Efficient grouping using hash maps
- In-memory sorting with Go's sort.Slice
- Lazy evaluation where possible

### Memory Management
- Streaming log entry processing
- Efficient data structures for grouping
- Minimal memory footprint for large datasets

## Usage Examples

### Security Analysis
```sql
SELECT ip, COUNT() as attempts 
FROM logs 
WHERE status >= 400 
GROUP BY ip 
HAVING attempts > 5 
ORDER BY attempts DESC
```

### Performance Analysis
```sql
SELECT url, AVG(size) as avg_response_size, COUNT() as requests
FROM logs 
WHERE status = 200
GROUP BY url 
ORDER BY avg_response_size DESC 
LIMIT 10
```

### Traffic Patterns
```sql
SELECT HOUR(timestamp) as hour, COUNT() as requests
FROM logs
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour
```
